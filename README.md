# ♻️ Android Project "TrashForCash" 📱
The Android Project TrashForCash is a development of an application called "TrashForCash." The concept is inspired by the German "Pfand" system, where a deposit is paid upon purchasing bottled or canned beverages. Containers marked with the Pfand logo can be returned to automated machines (Pfandautomat) at supermarkets in exchange for a voucher. This voucher—typically valued at €0.25 per item—can be redeemed for cash or used as store credit. Using this system as a case study, we have designed our application to facilitate a dual-sided recording (ledger) function.
